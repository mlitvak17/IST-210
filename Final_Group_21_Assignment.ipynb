        "Intro: Our group, group 21 originally decided to do our project on something that was unique. We wanted to make sure that no other group could possibly have the same idea. After some discussion we came up with the ingenious idea of roasted peanuts along the highway for maximum traffic. Our group designed our project from a business perspective keeping in mind all the important attributes about running a business. We began by picking key entities related to our business such as location, peanuts, employees. We then came up with attributes relating to each entity and created our diagram. We came to our final ER Diagram through trial and error and finalizing our best business model. \n",

He tells his family hey, how would you guys like to get some snacks and they reply with we would love to. John slams on the breaks and pulls off to our roasted peanut stand conveniently placed alongside the rest stop. John and his family come to the stand where we have an employee working hard. John notices the prices of our roasted peanuts and thinks they are a little expensive but he knows that he already pulled off the highway and has to make a purchase at this point, John does not want to let his kids down. John and his family purchase 4 bags of roasted peanuts and leave the stand satisfied as they are delicious.
